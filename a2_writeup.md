# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

One of the things that was difficult for me was making sure that I was returing the values in the correct format. If it wasn't formated in the way that the asserts were made, it would throw errors. 

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

You could use the match function when extracting information to figure out what the user is asking. Once the program knows what the user wants, it can take that and pull the neccesary values from the database. It will ensure that the chatbot works as expected.
